lminstreloc is short for LMMS instrument relocator

LMMS is a program I use(d) to build music with.

It used files where samples and soundfounts are stored, and after reorganizing them it can't find them anymore.
So I created this program, to change things all at once instead of having to do it for each instrument separately in the user interface.

basically it searches a module for the files used, checks if they exist, and presents the results in a UI so I can make changes and have them written back to the module.
